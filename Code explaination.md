# Sentiment Analysis : Code Description
This code is a sentiment analysis model based on the Naive Bayes classifier that uses the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library in Python. The model is trained on a dataset of tweets that have been labeled as either positive or negative. The purpose of the model is to predict the sentiment of new tweets as either positive or negative.

The code consists of several functions that perform different tasks:

`remove_noise` function takes a list of tweet tokens and removes noise from them, such as URLs, user mentions, stop words, and punctuation marks. The function returns a list of cleaned tokens.

`get_all_words` function takes a list of cleaned token lists and generates a flattened list of all words.

`get_tweets_for_model` function takes a list of cleaned token lists and generates a dictionary of word features for each tweet.

The `main` function of the code performs the following tasks:

1. It loads the data from the twitter_samples corpus that consists of positive and negative tweets.

2. It cleans the data using the remove_noise function.

3. It prepares the data by using the get_tweets_for_model function and creates a dataset for training and testing.

4. It shuffles the dataset to ensure randomness in the training and testing data.

5. It trains the Naive Bayes classifier on the training data.

6. It calculates the accuracy of the classifier on the testing data.

7. It prints the 10 most informative features of the classifier.

8. It predicts the sentiment of a custom tweet using the trained classifier.

9. It saves the trained model as a pickle file for future use.
